                <p>The Combat skill is leveled by killing monsters through any means - from sword, to bomb or slingshot.
                    The amount of experience gained is based upon the difficulty of the monster, in general. Further in
                    the mines and inside the Skull Cavern, harder monsters will appear which are worth much more
                    experience.</p>
                <p>Each level of the combat skill increases your character's maximum health by +5, which doesn't seem
                    like much but will result in you having 50% more HP by the time you've reached level 10. There is no
                    weapon proficiency, as swinging a sword, mace, etc. does not take any energy. This is to avoid you
                    collapsing while fighting, I suppose.</p>
                <p>When you go to the mines, you should get your first weapon and be able to slay slimes and bats
                    without much danger. Enemies like slimes are best fought by pinning them against the wall, where
                    they can be stunlocked. When that's not possible, you can simply slash, step, slash and prevent them
                    using their special jump attack. Many monsters are vulnerable to your knockback, so combat is quite
                    simple and a small roadblock to finding ore in the mines. You will want to level combat but it
                    should come fairly naturally.</p>
                <p>Bringing healing items to combat is essential. A mine run can be cut short very early if you have
                    nothing with which to heal your character. Cooked foods are generally better, though some foods like
                    Cauliflower provide a bit better healing.</p>

                <p>As you discover new items, you'll have the chance to put them on your character. Look to the bottom
                    left of the inventory screen to drag up to two rings and one pair of boots into the slots and equip
                    them on your character.</p>
                <p>You'll find a variety of effects on rings, but boots primarily focus on raising Defense and Immunity,
                    the former can be found on some weapons. Defense reduces the damage your character takes in combat
                    (I think by a flat amount). Immunity reduces the likelihood your character will be hit with negative
                    status effects, such as the slimes' slowing ability.</p>

            <div class="col grid_2_of_3">
                <p>As you progress through the mine, you may find that some monsters drop weapons that are better than
                    what you have. However, you'll probably find better items at the Adventurer's Guild. The amount of
                    weapons and gear offered by them increases as you delve further into the mines. Notable items are
                    the Silver Saber (750g, reached level 20), Templar's Blade (4,000G, level 55), Steel Falchion
                    (9,000G, level 90), and Lava Katana (25,000G, reached the bottom of the mines). The Lava Katana will
                    be immensely helpful in the Skull Cavern, so it's suggested you eventually save up for it unless you
                    get a very lucky Prismatic Shard Drop</p>
                <p>As of 1.07 the best weapon in Stardew Valley is the Galaxy Sword. You can get this weapon by finding
                    a Prismatic Shard. These shards drop from Iridium rocks in the mines, as well as the monsters you'll
                    fight there. The drop chance is very low. Going on lucky days and using foods that boost luck can
                    help (see the Skull Cavern page for a list of foods. Once you have the shard, you use it at the
                    center of 3 pillars in Calico Desert.</p>
