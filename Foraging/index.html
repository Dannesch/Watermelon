                <p>This skill levels slowly, and is likely the one you'll cap last unless you focus on it. Foraging
                    Skill experience is gained at a flat rate every time you fell a fully-grown tree or chop a stump or
                    log that provides hardwood. You also gain foraging skill levels by picking wild fruits and
                    vegetables from around the game world. When you grow wild seeds, that counts as foraging XP but
                    isn't as much experience as you'd get when collecting those items in the wild. This is because it's
                    not too hard to make dozens of foraged plants on your farm in any given season.</p>

                <p>Secondly, clearing areas outside of your farm - in particular the woods to the south - will give more
                    room for wild plants to appear. The more empty space, the better they will spawn. Finally, using the
                    Seed Maker will let you plant foraging crops on your farm. You get less than half the XP, but it's
                    easy to make dozens of seeds for each season if you find the key items to put into the seed maker.
                    The first two methods are probably the fastest ways to level foraging.</p>
                <p>It would appear from my testing that you do not gain any experience from digging things up with the
                    hoe or else the XP amounts are too small to notice even on a level 0 foraging character.</p>
