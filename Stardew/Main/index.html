                <p>Stardew is basically Harvest Moon on steroids, if you've ever played that. You're given a farm and
                    some seeds and the rest is up to you. You can fish all day, adventure in the mines, fill your farm
                    with animals or beehives, whatever. There are no real obligations to do (apart from orders/quests
                    and the community center, both of which are entirely optional).</p>
                <p>The story of Harvest Moon was also repeated in every game: your grandpa has died and you must take
                    over the farm. Stardew Valley has the same story, but with a modern twist: you’re leaving the rat
                    race behind for country living and the company you formerly worked for, Joja Corporation, is slowly
                    encroaching on the town you’re moving to.</p>
                <p>Joja Corporation is clearly a stand-in for companies like Wal-Mart, and the idea that the local
                    economy of Pelican Town is threatened by cheap prices and competition from Joja Mart is very true to
                    life and imbues your farming with some purpose.</p>

            <h2 id="farming" class="sub-title"><a href="../Farming/">Farming</a></h2>
            <p class="text">Farming is a nearly essential activity in Stardew Valley due to its huge potential for
                income and the useful crafting structures unlocked via leveling the skill. Farming is probably the most
                effective way to make money early on, in combination with other activities like foraging and fishing.
                The best part is that for the majority of the time you only need to water your plants, then wait on the
                return - what else you do with your farmer's day is up to you. This guide to farming in Stardew Valley
                will teach you a bit about how growth times and plant quality work, what you can expect when seasons
                change, the best skill bonuses to take at farming level 5 and 10, and how to get sprinklers going on
                your farm.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-section">
            <h2 id="foraging" class="sub-title"><a href="../Foraging/">Foraging</a></h2>
            <p class="text">Foraging is the act of chopping wood and collecting wild fruits and vegetables. Stardew
                Valley's Foraging Skill unlocks some useful crafting recipes, all the while making your use of the axe
                for woodcutting more efficient. Here's a guide to how foraging works, when you'll gain skill experience,
                and what some of the unlocked crafting items will do for your character.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-section">
            <h2 id="fishing" class="sub-title"><a href="../Fishing/">Fishing</a></h2>
            <p class="text">Fishing is probably the single hardest aspect of Stardew Valley, because it's not
                immediately obvious how it works. Worse, players may get discouraged because a hard-to-catch fish
                appears on their line, and they were never meant to be capable of catching it so early in the game. This
                tutorial explains the basics of the fishing minigame so that you can actually catch fish.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="sub-section">
            <h2 id="combat" class="sub-title"><a href="../Combat/">Combat</a></h2>
            <p class="text">Stardew Valley's Combat skill indicates your character's proficiency at fighting monsters
                found in the mines and Skull Cavern. Monsters are found elsewhere, but not in such large concentrations
                as in those two areas. Each Combat skill level you gain unlocks new crafting recipes and improves your
                prowess in combat by just a little.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h1 id="social" class="title">Social</h1>
        <p class="text">Friendship in Stardew Valley works on a simple point system. Each NPC has a friendship bar made
            up of 10 hearts, or 14 hearts for the player’s spouse. Each heart is equivalent to 250 friendship points.
        </p>
        <p class="text">Players gain and lose friendship points based on their interactions with NPCs, or
            non-interactions. Talking and giving gifts are the go-to methods for increasing friendship with NPCs. Not
            talking with NPCs on a daily basis damages friendship, as does giving disliked gifts or being caught while
            rummaging through garbage. Each NPC has a unique set of preferences when it comes to gifts, with NPCs loving
            anywhere from
            two to 11 gifts and potentially hating many more.</p>
        <p class="text">While each NPC has their own favorite items, there are certain items that are almost universally
            loved or hated. Prismatic Shards, Rabbit’s Feed, Golden Pumpkins, Magic Rock Candies, and Pearls are loved
            by almost all NPCs in the game. Meanwhile, some tools and resources like copper ore, torches, and Crab Pots
            will damage friendship.</p>
