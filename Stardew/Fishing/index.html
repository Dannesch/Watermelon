                <p>Head to the ocean or a river with your pole equipped. Press the action button and a meter will pop
                    up. The fuller the bar when you hit the button a second time, the further your line will be cast.
                    The bobber will attract different fish based upon where it lands. Further out from land is better
                    and usually has better catch rates. That's a good rule of thumb, and finding spots where you can
                    cast far from land will serve you well. An example of this is the left side of the docks on the
                    beach.</p>
                <p>Now you'll usually have a hit within 10 seconds. Wait for the sound and visual indication (an alarm
                    of sorts) and press the button once more. You'll begin the fishing minigame if you've got an actual
                    fish on the hook. Sometimes, you'll just reel in some seaweed.</p>
                <p>The fish will go up and down on the bar, and you've got this green box you can control by pressing
                    the action button. Your goal is to keep the fish inside the green box. While it's in these
                    boundaries, the main meter will fill up indicating you're catching the fish. Should the fish leave,
                    the meter will begin to drain, you'll hear a sound and the box will dim until it's behind the fish
                    again. When the fishing meter is full, you've caught the fish.</p>
                <p>Here's the main problem though - the fish is going to move, meaning you have to apply the right
                    amount of virtual 'pressure' to the line. It may move up or down and maybe even trick you by
                    bouncing around rapidly and erratically. These movements will come to indicate different types of
                    fish. This is why newcomers shouldn't get too discouraged when a fish seemed impossible to catch -
                    it may have been a legendary fish, and you're a newbie fisherman!</p>

                <p>Moving the bar upward means pressing left-click on the mouse or hitting the action button on the Xbox
                    controller. Holding the button will make it rise rapidly, and letting go will cause it to fall. So
                    how do we keep it in one spot? We click or press the button repeatedly in a rhythm so that the bar
                    is neither rising nor falling. Click a little faster, it'll go up. Click a little slower, it'll go
                    down. So hold to get it to rise a bit, then begin clicking to keep it in the correct spot and adjust
                    accordingly!</p>
                <p>If the fish goes down, you let up on the clicking a bit. If the fish goes up, hold and click. You'll
                    learn to control the rhythm of the green area. It has a bit of momentum to it. If the fish goes all
                    the way to the bottom, it can actually be hard at first because the box will 'bounce' when it hits
                    the bottom. Applying a little pressure just before it hits the bottom will make it bounce less. When
                    fish and box are both at the bottom it's very easy to reel it in - it happens automatically, and the
                    fish can only go up, so you can wait on that and react accordingly.</p>
                <p>Hopefully this helps you catch some fish in Stardew Valley. Each level of fishing will increase the
                    size of the green area, so it makes it a bit easier to catch the average fish. You'll have access to
                    tackle that helps immensely once you're in the levels 6-8 and have an Iridium Fishing Pole.
                    Eventually you'll get good enough to catch Legendary fish.</p>
                <p>Your character will gain fishing skill experience with each successful catch. At level 2, you can
                    start crafting/buying bait to put on the fiberglass fishing pole you can buy from the man in the
                    shop by the docks. This increases the rate of bites, so you can catch much more fish in a day. It
                    consequently makes fishing less boring, as there's less wait time between attempts. Have a look at
                    the How to Use Bait page for more information on bait and the tackle you'll unlock at level 6.</p>
