                <p>As you use the Farming skill - via harvesting crops or collecting from animals, you'll gain farming
                    skill experience. The more valuable the item, the more experience will be gained - so nothing is
                    lost by growing slower crops. Each level unlocks new buildings, professions, and increases your
                    farmer's proficiency with both the hoe and watering can. Proficiency improves the energy consumption
                    of using these items. Improved levels are mainly about the unlocks.</p>
                <p>In order to start a farm, you'll need to have the hoe, watering can, and some seeds ready. Use the
                    hoe to make rows 3 blocks wide and plant the seeds by using them on the tilled ground. You can now
                    water them. If you run out of water, head to the pond and use the watering can to fill up. I prefer
                    planting early crops in 3x10+ rows so that it's easy to water them with the level 1 watering can.
                    Stand in the center, water nine blocks, move a few spaces over and repeat the process until they're
                    all watered. Plants must be watered each day in order to grow, even those plants that repeatedly
                    produce upon maturity (such as hops and grapes). Not watering will stall them, so try not to miss
                    any spots.</p>

            <div class="spacing">
                <p>When and what to plant depends on the time of year. Each season is 28 days. If it is the 23rd and you
                    are planning to plant potatoes (grows in 6 days), they will not make it to maturity before the
                    season rolls over. The potatoes would be ready on the 29th, which doesn't exist. They'll die, and
                    you'll lose the financial investment. If a plant takes four days to mature and it is the 23rd, it
                    will be done on the 27th - you're counting from zero. For a one-time harvest, plants that repeatedly
                    produce fruit/vegetables are, in general, less profitable than those that can be picked only once,
                    so it'd be better to plant something that is a one-time boost when it's near the end of a season.
                    Crops that last all season (or multiple seasons as in the case with corn) are highly profitable when
                    planted early.</p>
